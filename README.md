# Nuxt + Bling

Very basic demo of using [bling](https://github.com/TanStack/bling) with Nuxt.

Does not work with SFC, though.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
